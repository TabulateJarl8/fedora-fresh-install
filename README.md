# fedora-fresh-install
A script for Fedora meant to be ran after a fresh install as a quality of life feature for me.

## How to use
Clone the repo, run the .sh file on your Fedora 41 system (if you get a permission denied error, be sure to do `chmod a+x` to make it runnable). I haven't tested this with any other releases, including Silverblue, so don't get mad at me if they don't work there.
